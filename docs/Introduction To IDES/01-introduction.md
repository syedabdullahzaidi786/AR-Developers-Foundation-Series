# Intro

## What is an IDE?

An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

### Why use an IDE?

-   **Efficiency**: Features like code completion (IntelliSense) and syntax highlighting help you write code faster and with fewer errors.
-   **Debugging**: Built-in debuggers allow you to step through your code to find and fix issues easily.
-   **Project Management**: IDEs help organize your files and resources, making it easier to navigate large projects.
-   **Integration**: They often integrate with version control systems like Git, terminals, and other tools.

## Popular IDEs

There are many IDEs available, each with its own strengths. In this module, we will explore some of the most popular ones:

1.  **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2.  **WebStorm**: A powerful commercial IDE for modern JavaScript development from JetBrains.
3.  **IntelliJ IDEA**: The leading Java and Kotlin IDE, also from JetBrains.
