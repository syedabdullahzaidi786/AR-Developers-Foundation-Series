# IntelliJ IDEA

**IntelliJ IDEA** is an IDE written in Java for developing computer software. It is developed by JetBrains and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and in a proprietary commercial edition.

## Key Features

-   **Deep Intelligence**: After IntelliJ IDEA has indexed your source code, it offers a blazing fast and intelligent experience by giving relevant suggestions in every context.
-   **Out-of-the-box Experience**: Mission-critical tools such as integrated version control systems and a wide variety of supported languages and frameworks are at hand — no plugin hustle included.
-   **Smart Code Completion**: While the basic completion suggests names of classes, methods, fields, and keywords within the visibility scope, the smart completion suggests only those types that are expected in the current context.
