# Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

![Visual Studio Code Interface](/img/ides/vscode.png)

**Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs.

## Key Features

-   **IntelliSense**: Go beyond syntax highlighting and autocomplete with smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.
-   **Debugging**: Print statement debugging is a thing of the past. Debug code right from the editor.
-   **Built-in Git**: Review diffs, stage files, and make commits right from the editor.
-   **Extensions**: Add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.
